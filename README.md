PROBLEM STATEMENT :  Predict the sentiments of Amazon Customers

Step 1 : Perform data preprocessing and prepare data for Modelling Purpose.

Step 2 : Exploratory data analysis

Step 2.1 : Analyse upvotes for different scores.

Step 3 : Create pivot table and heatmap of above problem satement for better conclusion.

Step 4 : Applying Bag of Words.

Step 5 : Removing stopwords.

Step 6 : Fitting data.

Step 7 : Splitting data using train_test_split.

Step 8 : Fitting training data into Logistic Regression Model.

Step 9 : Checking Model Accuracy.

Step 10 : Converting into a dataframe that was word and coefficient.

Step 11 : Sorting on the basis of coefficient and then words.

Step 12 : Getting top 20 positive words

Step 13 : Getting top 20 negative words.

Step 14 : Automating everything done so far i.e 
          a) Applying BOW.
          b)Checking model accuracy.
          c)Fetching top 20 positive words.
          d)Fetching top 20 negative words.
   
Step 15 : Doing the same by applying TF - IDF instead of BOW.

Step 16 : Applying techniques for Handling data imbalance.(RandomOverSampler)
 
Step 17 : Doing cross validation using GridSearchCV
